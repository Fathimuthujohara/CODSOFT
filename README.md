# CODSOFT TASK 1- Iris Flower Classification

The Iris flower dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning used for classification tasks. It consists of measurements of iris flowers categorized into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The goal is to train a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Dataset Overview:
The Iris dataset contains the following features:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal lengtH
Petal width

And the target variable:
Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

Steps Involved:
1. Data Preprocessing:
   Load the dataset.
   Check for missing values.
   Encode categorical target variable into numerical labels if needed.
   Split the data into training and testing sets.
2. Data Visualization and Statistical Analysis:
   Visualize the dataset to understand the distribution of features.
   Explore relationships between features using scatter plots, pair plots, etc.
   Calculate statistical measures like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
3. Model Building:
1. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
2. Random Forest:
3. Logistic Regression:
4. Model Evaluation:
   Compare the performance of all models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   Choose the best performing model.
